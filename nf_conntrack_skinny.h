/* [1] suggests that the default connection tracking time for Skinny

 * sent down the control TCP connection by the handset every 20
 * seconds. Reasonable values for the connection tracking timeout
 * would be greater than a switch's spanning tree port forwarding hold
 * down, plus TCP retry time and would require at least three
 * KeepAlives to be lost. So values above 100 seconds are reasonable.

/* The Skinny protocol may have multiple protocol data units with
 * one TCP packet. The stream of Skinny PDUs looks like this:
 *   msg_len link_msg_type ... msg_len link_msg_type ...
 * The msg_len is the number of bytes in ...
 * The link_msg_type specifies the encryption or compression of the
 * payload. Only 0 has been seen in the wild, meaning plain text.  If
 * other vaules are seen then this PDU cannot be safely decoded.
 *
 * In all packets seen to date the first 4 bytes of ... are the
 * msg_id. This is the function of the PDU. Note carefully that the
 * PDU is extensible -- depending on the value of msg_len fields may
 * or may not exist. So it is an error to assume that seeing a
 * particular value of msg_id implies that all of that message's
 * fields will follow.
 *
 * Field numeric values are usually lowest significant byte
 * first. Confusingly, some networking fields (such as IPv4 Address)
 * are given as most significant byte first (ie, "network byte
 * order"). The representation of UDP Port is a bizaare combination of
 * both.
 *
 * Field string values are left aligned and '\0' padded. There is no
 * terminating '\0'.

/* Message IDs that contain network addresses or ports and thus need
 * to come to the attention of Network Address Translation.  In the
 * future we might want to additionally track OpenRecieveChannel,
 * CloseReceiveChannel and StopMediaTransmission and bring down the
 * RTP connections implied by those messages' ConferenceID and
 * PassThruPartyID.  That would free up resources in preference to
 * letting the NAT time out.

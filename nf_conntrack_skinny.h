 * RTP/UDP/IP voice streams when a phone call is placed or

 * connection so the Call Manager knows if the IP Phone is alive and
 * ready for calls which may be placed to it.

 * sent down the control TCP connection by the handset every 20
 * seconds. Reasonable values for the connection tracking timeout
 * would be greater than a switch's spanning tree port forwarding hold
 * down, plus TCP retry time and would require at least three
 * KeepAlives to be lost. So values above 100 seconds are reasonable.

/* The Skinny protocol may have multiple protocol data units within
 * one TCP packet. The stream of Skinny PDUs looks like this:
 *
 *   msg_len link_msg_type ... msg_len link_msg_type ...
 *
 * The msg_len is the number of bytes in ... It is possible that
 * msg_len could be 0, although this has never been seen.
 *
 * The link_msg_type specifies the encryption or compression of the
 * payload. Only 0 has been seen in the wild, meaning plain text.  If
 * other vaules are seen then the PDU cannot be safely decoded.
 *
 * In all packets seen to date the first 4 bytes of ... are the
 * msg_id. This indicates the function and structure of the remainder
 * of the PDU. Note carefully that the PDU is extensible -- depending
 * on the value of msg_len fields may or may not exist. So it is an
 * error to assume that seeing a particular value of msg_id implies
 * that *all* of that message's fields will follow.
 *
 * Field numeric values are usually lowest significant byte
 * first. Confusingly, networking fields (such as IPv4 Address and UDP
 * Port) are given as most significant byte first (ie, "network byte
 * order").
 *
 * Some 16-bit numeric values are padded with zeros. UDP Port is the
 * most confusing of these, with the port number in network byte order
 * but the padding in the LSB order resulting in this bizarre sequence
 * on the wire:
 *
 *    udp_port(msb) | udp_port(lsb) | 0 | 0
 *
 * Field string values appear to be left aligned and
 * '\0'-padded. Although a terminating '\0' has been seen on all
 * strings to date, in the absence of a specification there is no
 * assurance that this will remain so.

PACKAGES REQUIRED FOR BUILD

Fedora 8

    # yum install kernel-devel

BUILDING

    $ make

  CC [M]  /home/gdt/nf_skinny/trunk/nf_conntrack_skinny.o
  Building modules, stage 2.
  MODPOST 1 modules

    # make modules_install

Sometimes
    # depmod
since Ubuntu sometimes says this is run, but it isn't.


KERNEL API CHANGES

Fedora 8 on Intel Core Duo

Linux roma.44ansell.gdt.id.au 2.6.24.3-12.fc8 #1 SMP Tue Feb 26 14:58:29 EST 2008 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux

 - doesn't accept mask in struct nf_conntrack_helper
 - has altered prototype for helper, removing an indirection


SOCKET BUFFERS

See
  http://ftp.gnumonks.org/pub/doc/skb-doc.html
but this is missing more recent functions

Even more annoyingly the newer functions don't have doxygen comments either.

skb_header_pointer() -- use the returned pointer, not the passed-in buffer.


TESTING

Testing packet interception can be done using telnet, as follows.

$ make
# make modules_install

# iptables --append INPUT \
  --match state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED --jump ACCEPT
# iptables --append INPUT --jump ACCEPT

# modprobe nf_skinny
# in.telnetd -debug 2000

$ telnet localhost 2000


NAMING

Skinny is Cisco Systems' propietary IP phone control protocol.
The protocol has gone by a number of names:
 - Cisco Skinny Station Protocol, Cisco Systems' currently preferred name.
 - Selsius Connection Control Protocol (SCCP, but this is also used for
   SS7 Signalling Connection Protocol)
so we'll just use Skinny, which has been the protocol's informal name
from the start.

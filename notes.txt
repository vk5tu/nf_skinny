SOCKET BUFFERS

See
  http://ftp.gnumonks.org/pub/doc/skb-doc.html
but this is missing more recent functions

Even more annoyingly the newer functions don't have doxygen comments either.

skb_header_pointer() -- use the returned pointer, not the passed-in buffer.


TESTING

Testing packet interception can be done using telnet, as follows.

$ make
# make modules_install

# iptables --append INPUT \
  --match state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED --jump ACCEPT
# iptables --append INPUT --jump ACCEPT

# modprobe nf_skinny
# in.telnetd -debug 2000

$ telnet localhost 2000
